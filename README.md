**Mobile App Automation using Appium**

This project focuses on automating the testing of a Mobile App's Business Logic (BL) using the Appium framework. It utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) and TestNG as the testing framework. The project also incorporates the Extent Report library to generate comprehensive reports that display the results of passed, failed, and skipped test cases. It supports both smoke and regression testing scenarios.

**Overview**

Mobile App Automation using Appium is a comprehensive framework designed to automate the testing of the BL of a mobile application. The framework employs the Appium tool, which enables cross-platform testing for Android and iOS devices. By utilizing the POM design pattern and TestNG, the project offers a structured and scalable approach to test case development and execution. The Extent Report library enhances the reporting capabilities by providing detailed and visually appealing reports.

**Features**

The Mobile App Automation project offers the following key features:

**Appium Integration:** The framework integrates with Appium to automate interactions with the mobile app under test. It supports both Android and iOS platforms, enabling cross-platform testing.

**Page Object Model (POM):** The POM design pattern is utilized to enhance test case maintainability and reusability. Each page or screen of the mobile app is represented as a separate class, encapsulating the associated elements and actions.

**TestNG Testing Framework:** TestNG is employed as the testing framework, providing essential features such as test case management, parallel execution, test case dependencies, and data-driven testing.

**Extent Report Integration:** The Extent Report library is integrated to generate detailed HTML reports that showcase the execution results, including passed, failed, and skipped test cases. The reports offer visual representations, logs, and screenshots for enhanced result analysis.

**Smoke and Regression Testing:** The framework supports both smoke testing (quick verification of critical functionality) and regression testing (comprehensive testing of the entire application) scenarios, allowing flexibility in test suite execution.
